    "When running the LTOP workflow there is a circumstance where ties can occur in the paramater selection process. In these instances, version 0.1.0 is just selecting the first item in the df. However, for reproducability and to improve the param set pick, a more codified score/rank approach is required. This notebook is for working out the logic of that process before it is integrated into the existing workflow. This was developed in the ltop_py env on Islay. "
